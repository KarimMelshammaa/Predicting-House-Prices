# Predicting-House-Prices
This project aims at constructing a model that predicts house prices in Madrid. The dataset is from Kaggle.com. Since the training data has so many features, several steps of feature engineering were done to try and extract the relevant features. After that, a Lasso Regression model was implemented and the results are in the predictions file.
